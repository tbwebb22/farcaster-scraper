common question here pre-10k qDAU was re IRL tipping culture

everyone was like wtf tipping culture out of control, reign it in

❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 pay attention: this is one of the most interesting memecoin implementations. why?

A. leverages memecoins as "attention assets" on a platform where you've already chosen to focus your attention

B. time bounds the attention-driven ephemeral hype cycle of memecoins

both A+B can 10x the power + focus of that attention Me too🔥 perhaps the value of the current moment is that we are making our way towards furthering our understanding of what factors are important in building systems that incentivise certain behaviours

levels at which innovation is occurring in the stack include culture/branding, social platform integration

more to come? "Good morning." It looks like this u can learn a lot about a person by how they stack the dishwasher. The moon 😍 who makes the list for top 5 people in your life you would hate to get April fooled from?

landlords have gotta be on the list and medical professionals I'm uncertain what I think about Vitalik's post about chaos and degen communism.

I keep thinking about the book, "Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck--Why Some Thrive Despite Them All" by Jim Collins.

I don't like chaos. But I prepare and can roll with it which leads to success.

I don't WANT chaos though. my cope: convincing myself that i’m the blacked out pfp on all of my homies’ version of @fiveoutofnine.eth’s inner circle project

Have a good day $DEGEN What are your favorite channels? i loved watching @benersing’s video reaction to my own video

it felt more human and connected, even though it was still shared async

it allowed for more nuance and tone than two hundred some odd characters allows

my best friends and i send each other short videos throughout the week for this reason.

more of this My first short-form video (ever): an honest answer to @Ted 's genuine question about memecoins and my / your why. 

Let's see how this goes... Guess where it is? The evolution of Easter 🧵

strong conviction that $degen (+ potentially $higher) are not memecoins, but a brandnew category providing unprecedented P2P purpose and therefore a sense of fulfillment unique across tokens

your answers are important to me Can you believe solidarity is persecuted? I have a snack right now that's worth $10, but I'm not going to buy it and I'm going to use it somewhere else. How much is it going to be worth?

follow plz My cat is gamer, too Made me think of @ted living her best life as a free agent. 

🌖🏄‍♀️ from SJ’s last days: 

“as we grow older, and hopefully wiser, we realize that a $3000 or a $30 watch both tell the same time. you’ll realize that your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. whether you fly first class or economy, if the plane goes down—you go down with it” wdyt? 안녕하세용 맞팔 부탁드려요^^ @ted as somebody who appreciates fine art (like oil paintings and ish) how would you honestly grade my very first NFT collection? 

Please be brutally honest?  Every good I’ve fallen deep down the @ted rabbithole on /drakula and all I can say is she has the best teeth I’ve ever seen help me follow i paused many such cases last night and this is the screen i opened my laptop to while having my coffee this morning...

@ted @nonlinear.eth without looking it up, dare you to guess with whom this interview is and what year

one of the best archived articles i've revisited in a long, long time

it reads so parallel to what + why we're building today w/ crypto that it makes me feel solidarity and optimistic about achieving our collective vision of the future Book burning

the more i see "answer my generic question and i'll tip you in degen"

the more it feels like "i'll pay you to be my friend" energy Ok was talking about this with @ted today and then saw this,  so felt it right to open it up 

I want to know where you stand. 

Are you a reading person or a video person? 

Do you think a shift towards video content is a net positive? 

More info in replies 🧵 looking at replies to this. shaking my head.

article doesn’t rely on any concrete data or unequivocal evidence for the accusations.

relies on personal accounts and observations.

so “trust me bro”.

quite amusing it’s the opposite to his approach to his content. always based on published clinical studies. Part of the reason I love bootstrapping is because of the complete freedom to do your best work, on your own terms. 

It’s a fulfilling privilege to have that freedom to express yourself authentically through what you build and how you build it. huberman hit piece is a reflection of society

he didn’t make himself a god-like figure, we (society) did

no one except for god is free of sin

if we treated him as a mere mortal, we would expect these sins (as we should)

religion’s purpose is to come as we are, sins and all.

therapy = confession =/= free of sin In crypto, if you're not taking L's, you're probably not exposing yourself to enough of the frontier

You will never get everything right. Don't sweat it, lick your wounds when you need to, and keep looking forward. Continuing to stay in the game, survive, and deploy your attention and money will lead to good outcomes harsh reality monday

what's a "tough truth" for you that, when you accept it, will lead to a wider set of opportunities, a clearer path forward, better decision-making, and more meaningful actions?

mine is i probably have, at best, <250 true fans here despite my audience common fallacy i often see people in crypto make when they see a unique project become successful:

1. first they claim it to be the new standard and/or strategy

2. then they engage with it and evaluate it in the same exact way they would with every other project

both 1 and 2 disregard the uniqueness of the project look ma, i made it

i would like to thank the academy (aka @robin), my parents for their tough yet unconditional love and their encouragement of my independent spirit, and @zora for allowing me to mint this memory and hold it forever

ps if you’re not following /robin, you probably should :) They're trying to cancel Huberman today for being a thot Please don't feed your FOMO monster!
When do we understand that we've made a bad decision? Not in the moment we make it, but long after, when we have new information, knowledge or experience.
1/Build confidence in yourself and your decisions
2/Set motivating personal goals
3/Seek support from community or professionals I know that staying optimistic can be a challenge. Most of the time, our lives do not look like the picture below. But here are my top 3 pieces of advice to help you maintain a positive outlook:
1. Practice gratitude
2. Practice self-care
3. Find purpose and meaning

-20% of people i meet (or don’t meet) won’t like me, maybe for a specific reason or no reason or a dumb reason, its inevitable

it is the vernal equinox, when daylight hours exactly equals hours of darkness in the northern hemisphere.

this happens again around sept 22, the autumnal equinox.

from now until sept 22, days are longer than nights. 

i love the early dawn and i love the lingering dusk. I need your best advice for a 12hr+ flight. How to say sane? How to manage anxiety? How to not die of boredom? I've thought a lot about AI art and whether or not we should think about it as art. You can read all about it in this article. From the article title you can probably guess where I fall on this topic.
https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/in-defense-of-ai-art How can people without a lot of followers start successful channels? 

I feel like the people starting channels that are successful already have a large following and while not crazy expensive or anything, paying $25 and then having no engagement seems like a double whammy. in 2018 i worked for a vc backed crypto prediction market. i attended meetups and let ppl know what we did. 

at one of these events an attendee told me he didn't care how it worked, he just wanted to get rich.

i felt similar vibes before the pullback. i hope the market recalibrates to utility. I brought a journalist friend of mine onto FC and he felt fruitful conversation about current events doesn't exist outside of the tech scene. What channels can we foster that bring more non-crypto enthusiasts to FC? i (and others) wanna see more non-crypto and non-Farcaster meta content (guilty of this myself)

so i’m adjusting how /ted functions

cast interesting things here and i’ll reward with:

a) distribution
b) engagement
c) warps
d) degen
e) a fifth secret thing that’ll come to light in a month or so

don’t abuse it what resources/guides are out there explaining how to get the most out of warpcast? "GM☀️Hi all
F4F
100% back now!"!!! i have enough non-work work on my plate that i need to automate OR hire a virtual assistant. please recommend low-cost services that will help with:

- personal: calendar management, appointments, reservations, bookkeeping, groceries (embarrassed to even cast that)

- brand: inbox, expenses, proofreading, project mgmt my community immune system = the CLUB TED @hypersub GC

the level of thoughtfulness, empathy + INTEGRITY across a group of builders pushing forward the leading edge of tech is rare AF

1. i have never vaped and never zyn’d in my life. am i missing out? why or why not?

2. i have never looked into ticker nor participated in any ticker in my life. am I missing out? why or why not?

these questions are not unrelated i want to start a restaurant


(ok guys i already know it is one of the most challenging margin businesses ever, dont rain on my parade)

also how do i upload videos to warpcast SOS you ever just think fuck it i wanna live a small life in a cozy town and tend to a garden and read books by the fire and live life blissfully unaware of what’s happening beyond a 10 mile radius







or just me this is a @ted fan account now Our fearless leader takes the stage.. There is no farcaster, it’s just @ted managing an enormous spreadsheet of posts TIL

Let’s foster more dignity in the world.

Full essay linked below the snip ⬇️

https://open.substack.com/pub/devinbaker/p/the-infinite-path-to-dignified-genius?r=5pzp2&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true Nothing to claim! it is WILD to me that we only have allowlists for minting and NOT for secondary sales.

that’s not how the trading of art, luxury goods, family heirlooms, homes, even surfboards works.

most secondary marketplaces IRL have a curation layer to filter buyers.

this is why NFT marketplaces lose volume to private txns :) boosts are great for gaining initial attention. Once done, a creator can:

- identify who their real collectors are (e.g., bello)
- build gated experiences
- create hypersub subs

cultivating a community holds more value than prioritizing the first minting profits re: boosts + free mints 

imo, they may be better for the platform than for the creator. it’s a bit of a psyop.

creator gets distribution and $$, but do they acquire any new fans?

bull case: some of the free minters will convert to superfans 

bear case: creators care most about fans and $$ won’t make up for that Everyone's buzzing about the latest memecoin adventure, promising community and action. But haven't we danced this dance with NFTs before? As waves of hype push us from one trend to the next, it makes you wonder—are we just chasing the thrill, mistaking fleeting excitement for real loyalty? fc bf, fc gf


there’s actually no other acceptable way one time at the end of yoga class during shavasana i had the most vivid visualization of me, myself, in a big ass tub filled to the brim with my favorite french fries (hot, salty, crispy) and the tub had 8 faucets that would each pour out a distinct, world class flavor of aioli.


i think about this daily. who is the kanye west of farcaster?

intentionally leaving out which era of kanye west, that’s up to your own interpretation I woke up today and watched a 1 hour long podcast episode of @ted’s conversation with @nonlinear.eth — such good vibes bro i flew straight to Vegas from ETHDenver for a fintech conference and everyone is calling me [redacted] and i don’t like it make it stop hahaha one of my superpowers is connecting the dots.

one of @greg’s is shipping at farcaster speed.

I love this place. thanks @jesse for giving us (greg) a reason to ship.

disclosure: i've only seen SF-based gen Z males posting about this so assume my baseline knowledge is zero genuine question: but what if the internet is down? like what if there is no connectivity, then you can't technically be "onchain" right?

i think about this more than i want to admit i believe the future will be creator-led and that the trust built between creators and their communities should be rewarded. 

while this “reward” is based on # of followers and active badge status, this is only the beginning of realizing that future given all on- and offchain data available.

ty @benbassler.eth @nonlinear.eth how many $degen will it take to throw the round? if Farcaster is the protocol for all of social media, will I be able to subscribe to one's Stories but not to their Warpcast (reddit/twitter style) or the other way round?

I want to see some people's text casts but not their stories/tiktoks

if follow = follow everywhere thats not it.
Client side followings/mutings? "Don't change to be with someone" is terrible advice.
You HAVE to change to be with someone. That is how you grow together. What you can't do is ignore your needs or ignore your feelings. holy mother of /perl. 

this is literally would have been impossible to get if not for @variant and @jesse — this has to be exclusive and part of a private collection. wild wild wild. 

if you’re not entering this sweepstakes, i don’t know what to say. went for my usual early AM coffee walk, FaceTimed my parents, took them along with me, saw the capitol building, got lots of sunlight, ran into farcaster friend and WOW it’s not even 9am yet i love the simple things in life

ps @greg there’s hot chocolate at my hotel come get it 

pps see everyone tn in denver :) In honour of you putting me on to these rad chaps with their LVMH episode @ted I’m dropping the latest here. 

So much value I’ve had in the year since your intro 🙏

Highly recommended. 

https://open.spotify.com/episode/3JnXyI5G7umpVWijAvoL36?si=GGefrJ8QSoKYtuNqrVxeTg okay, i'll bite. can someone explain the 🍖🍖🍖 to me? genuine political question:

if you believe in a free democracy, how do you grapple with the fact that the DNC isn’t  having debates for any of its presidential nominees and will likely not allow for a presidential debate? 

i genuinely don’t understand why it seemingly doesn’t bother anyone, regardless of party. 🤮 This is what Bitcoin Fever looks like Wen wallet management of kids wallet that teach them financial responsibility and help them make $ from their bed???

If we can’t onboard our kids, who then? but here is the result.

children in the arab world stick with parents for longer. 

americans push for independence at 18. 

now thinking the reason for this divergence is possibly the burn out associated with the fact american parents spend 100% of their free time (physically & mentally) with their kids from 1 to 18. always seemed to me that the american family nucleus was not as strong as it is in arab culture. 

surprised i have seen the opposite.

parents in OC are much more involved with their children than most parents in the ME, where access to cheap live-in help & drivers means delegating most redundant kid related tasks. the merkle team continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with warps — now introducing "subscribe" with warps via @hypersub.

if "warps" implemented at the protocol, you can imagine paying for an in-app subscription with whatever currency a client enables.

too bad it wasn't avail for /clubted launch :) i’m just gonna say it because ive thought it at least 3 times since ive been here:

men in austin look more like “men” than men in los angeles Copped: Mint many such cases :) episode 2 
 got a question for @ted and @nonlinear.eth after listening to your ep.1!

How can journalists and media brands effectively use Warpcast's community-driven features and economic tools to build their presence and engage audiences more deeply than on traditional social media? trying this out from @watcher — anonymous AMA like ngl. he can attest to the anonymity of it. encourage you not to hold back :)

won’t be able to respond to any of them until tonight, but will post all answers to this thread.

https://x.com/_kartal_41/status/1761770793954881575?s=46&t=OgAx3qdBba4xUkwv0yUfUA was a slow sunday on fc, thanks for some spice earlier in the day today @ted 

and I see how it is @woj.eth, didn't even mute you https://warpcast.com/jacopo.eth/0xc75ed8a4 new name just dropped. felt cute, might delete later. deleted this bc @ace and @peter said they won't do @perl cast vs cast again.

if you muted @woj.eth, please unmute him; he posts bangers, pushes farcaster to be better + is building a killer farcaster app with @supercast.

to all builders: remember that often the most thoughtful, not the most viral, apps win long-term. i think offering people tokens to mute someone is worse than spamming nice things about people you follow 🤷 magic morning 🧞 I'm going to start a show soon. My cohost will be my brother. He has a phd in neuroscience and we can discuss things for hours. The main reason is that I have been wanting to be invited to shows for years and decided the only way to speak with hosts of other shows will be to invite them to mine. Any suggestions? also want to see the /ted crew's opinions on this personal thoughts on 🇺🇸 having been here for a couple of years now.

melting pot of cultures. yes cliche.

OC is a mix of white/black, asians, persians, latinos, and arabs. 

while each group retains its own culture, pure "american culture" exists in this weird world of commoditized seasonal & sports festivities. reminder that as a builder it is SO important to ship the "barely enough" even if it makes you cringe at yourself and feel embarrassed about putting it out in public because it isn't your highest quality work.

as @nonlinear.eth says, "if its too polished, they waited too long to ship".

(still cringing though) Super interesting. Still thinking about this experiment @ted did. It gave me flashbacks to the early 90s boom of VCR board games, which leveraged the medium to be more interactive. Does anybody else remember these?
https://youtu.be/gcfn4oIF7pE?si=g3E6Xe_Kn42gI9aO&t=169 turns out my pod editing skills are more mid than my dev skills but here's a sneak peak on what @nonlinear.eth and i have been cooking: many such cases :)

dropping later today in /manysuchcases on @zora, spotify, apple podcasts, youtube, and whatever web3 podcast platforms you think we should try. observation having lived across 3 continents.

level of obesity in CA is alarming. not sure why it seems that being healthy & eating well has somewhat been dragged into the partisan culture war.

if you are already driving around disney on a scooter, then u really don’t need that 2L double caramel mocha frappuccino. being intentional about where you live based on your current priorities is so important to general health and happiness. I sense that in my pursuit of living better, I’ve been focusing on the wrong word.

I’ve been seeking BETTER, instead of LIVE better, and it ain’t working anymore.

It’s time to live more deeply, instead of seeking better.

Link to full essay⬇️

https://www.comma.org/p/seeking-better-vs-seeking-to-live TLDR: i need new DC features OR (more likely) to ship a frame that takes inquiries / outreach and outputs into my database to make it easier for me to prioritize.

the unread count has risen to 108 and won't have time to dive in until later today/tmrw/this weekend and trying to prio as best i can!  tank u for patience golf course in korea buasan i love personal channels because they reveal the venn diagram overlap of things in on my mind and what i think will resonate with that person Crypto isn't just about wealth; it's about reshaping the fabric of finance. Join us in the revolution. ✊🔄 guess what @nonlinear.eth was explaining to me, wrong answers only.

ps i can't stop laughing at this and yes we're cooking 👀 @ted!!!!!! You are famous!!! 

https://youtu.be/zROkwa7x4xM?si=FDCSDDOcbnqeyODv&t=204 ✨🚶🏻‍♂️ do you guys realize how wildly lucky most of us are to be “knowledge workers”?

it grants us the benefit of working remotely, not worrying about slowing down physically, engaging with innovation, and accessing better earning potential and flexibility to pursue our own interests.

please don’t take it for granted. 🖤 How scary but beautiful it looks how you know we are homies for life: i ask for your real # so we can chat on iMessage instead of DCs or GCs :) i invested in $degen bc i believe in @jacek and what he is building on top of farcaster.

his approach to using farcaster's on/offchain data + social graph — from antisybil bounties + public degen APIs for devs to building a cultural community strong enough that i boycotted FC — is the most innovative to date. PSA: this is me about to go through my DCs. 

100 warps to whoever guesses this movie first. this is so dope.

frames like this that leverage the unique nature of farcaster’s social graph to encourage connection are top tier and truly get *it*.

the only thing that would make this better is if the last frame’s buttons linked to send a direct DC the people shown to say hi.

cc @cassie :) I want @perl NFT to show me what got me here won’t get me there, because I have no clue what I’m doing one of the best gifts we have ever given my dad (other than the Ooni pizza oven, iykyk) is mybirdbuddy.com — a smart bird feeder that captures your winged visitors.

now our family group chat gets a video like this 3x a week and we would all score 100% on a bird quiz, which may be my dad's favorite part of it all. Is there a Farcaster knowyourmeme channel or can someone clue me in on “approach exclusive NFTs the same way”? “i think, therefore i am.” descartes realization of self through thought mirrors our understanding of value in the digital realm. 
approach exclusive nfts the same way. In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.

Approach exclusive NFTs the same way. what did you get done this week?

approach exclusive NFTs the same way. In October 331 BC, Alexander the Great, through superior ground infantry tactics, defeated Darius III & completed his conquest of the Persian empire

His steed (which got him here), wouldn’t get him there to the Indian Ocean (he’d need a boat)

approach exclusive NFTs the same way. In the 1660's, as an apple fell from a tree and ostensibly struck his head, Sir Isaac Newton was struck by the forces of inspiration, leading him to formulate the universal law of gravitation. It was a unique moment where nature seemed to conspire to advance human knowledge.

Approach exclusive NFTs the same way. i will tip my entire $degen allowance to whomever can troll me harder than @zachterrell, @nonlinear.eth, and @4484 already have*


*may not be possible, they set the bar pretty high in 1928, Alexander Fleming stumbled upon a mold in a petri dish, which led to the discovery of penicillin, revolutionizing modern medicine and saving countless lives. serendipity met preparation, transforming an accident into a breakthrough.

approach exclusive NFTs the same way. in 1941 claude shannon began working at bell labs. encountering the problem of message entropy, he would later publish “a mathematical theory of communication” and in doing so, single-handedly invent the field of information theory

approach exclusive NFTs the same way sometime between 1717 and 1720 Bach returned from Carlsbad to find his wife had died in his absence. he then went on to write the Chaconne, one of this most revered and complex pieces in the Baroque canon

approach exclusive NFTs the same way. i worked my ass off to get into princeton (surprise!) — an exclusive status symbol that many pay a lot of $$$ to acquire.

and while the status symbol may make life easier, it doesn’t actually matter.

what matters what you do with it. what got you here won’t get you there.

approach exclusive NFTs the same way. If you think you need code to make frames, think different. 👩‍💻 too attached to the beep sound now 🐶 another frame experiment :)

don't skip the "start here" step. if you do, you'll regret it.

https://frames.neynar.com/f/73221992/742d00a6 🕯️ Will this monster ever stop?
What price do you think it will reach? in the spirit of respectful debate:

most of our FC followers are airdrop/free mint farmers so they'd agree, not disagree, with this :)

agree we need to design for positive contributions BUT its more nuanced than that

imo clicking a button =/= microwork, volatile token requiring 24/7 tracking =/= economic prosperity if you haven't checked it out yet, new "stories" just dropped at 3:30pm PT.

lmk what you think and what else you want out of this frame experience — i'm experimenting, innovating, and iterating. Hey guys 👋 february 17, 2024: experimenting with farcaster "stories" via @neynar

throughout the day, buttons on the second frame will jump skip you forward. check back in at 3:30pm, 7:30pm, and 10:30pm.

https://frames.neynar.com/f/6f89a5ac/505cd276 ted (on farcaster) character arc: 30% of my DCs are now customer support requests X post from @flynn.eth, who may know more about airdrops than anyone else in the space.

change my mind:

current one-click mint frames are just airdrops, not value drivers.

their distribution is just another flavor of TVL, not LTV.

and if airdrops don’t “work”, why should we expect one-click mint frames to? gm, happy friday. two evidence-driven end-of-week thoughts:

- if farcaster wins it is for the benefit of *all* of society, not just you and your brand (although that's a nice perk)

- those that will win the next "cycle" are focused on that ^ as the north star; they're not focused on cycles or price charts or virality gm. Cryptocurrency investing tip: Don't. Unless you enjoy emotional rollercoasters. 🔥FOLLOW

(yes im going through a thomas lelu phase) @ted is a masterclass in farcaster. 

h/t 🎩 respect ✨ frames like this — and not the frames focused on speculative NFTs and memecoin airdrops — are the future of consumer social and consumer generally. 

idc if its a web2 copy. frames that lean into social networks, spark playful interactions, and create with a human-centered approach will win long-term.

ty @watcher if this is early access for /ted channel users, imagine what early access will look like for /clubted members and CLUB TED subscribers. Lets see if we can usurp the incumbent Members of OG yup user Ted’s channel are whitelisted for @yup, claim it below 😎

https://warpcast.com/nir/0x762607ac Getting sick, even with just food poisoning like I've got right now, really makes you realize how lucky you are when you're healthy. We should really be more thankful for the times when we feel good. The reason why crypto is so great is because it is a synergic satisfier of many fundamental human needs. It helps satisfy our needs for protection by reducing dependency on specific agents and by enabling anonymity. It helps satisfy our need for freedom by enabling self-custody. Continued below @tbi you gotta post these bangers on farcaster too, give the people what they want  thank god for CLUB TED, the antidote for civilization I just minted CLUB TED ORIGINAL because how could i not My Club Ted edition makes my wallet look popular i went to mexico city for 72 hours and accidentally missed a lifetime of vacation at Club Ted 🤦‍♂️

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7sDLeSGIHw I've dedicated the last 13 months after leaving my job to learning and growing.

But I feel stuck.

Recently I've been wondering - can a relentless pursuit of personal growth actually backfire and be keeping me stuck?

Full essay ⬇️

100 warps to the best answer... and potentially early access to something similar and potentially more spicy that i have in the works 👀

context here: warpcast.com/ted/0x4e8f6e55 Anotha one 🧪 robotic worlds is coming why is ted on the chopping block

what's going on reminder that life beautiful and ugly and fun and awful and chaotic and transcendent all at once and that we as humans contain multitudes and THIS is what makes us feel alive !!!*



*major cope for spilling coffee all over myself and getting my car towed AND launching a product and seeing farcon passes minted 🙃😜 this will be the norm in a few years, if not sooner.

coinbase will be integrated into e-commerce sites, e-commerce will be integrated into farcaster apps, and you will be interoperable across all apps.

no one will know nor need to know the tech behind it.

all they will know is the smoothest consumer experience ever. HOT TAKE: normalize read receipts + ghosting

read receipts: ask yourself if you have control over whatever it is that makes you uncomfortable about them (hint: you do)

ghosting: you'll follow up if it matters, they'll respond if it matters. if not, signal for mutual disengagement in a v efficient manner.

sry @greg ! Met @ted IRL tonight.

Thats it. Thats the Cast. What if I do want to get more emails from @ted though? hey @ted just wanted to say i've seen you on TT forever and it's very cool to see you on this here site

we TT under AIForHumansShow (which we should prob get on Farcaster soon) but anyways, nice work on all yet content What’s good Ted can I join the gang what’s the initiation one of my career nonnegotiables is working with world class, all star people. lucky for me, two of my fav ever are on here:

- require like + recast in frames always
- import engagement farming CT norms

change my mind? gm, just got outta the water and saw arnold schwarzenegger biking down the board walk and it’s about to dump rain so question for you:

what’s one of your legitimate hot takes? 

like an opinion you’re too afraid to say out loud?

asking genuinely. zero judgment zone, and i am sure others here may agree with you. Mavia someone actually told me tn “you’re a feature and a bug” and this might be crazy but i think i feel… seen?!? one of my fav steve jobs quotes:

“you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. you have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.”

it has never felt as true as it does right now. this tiktokted was meant for crypto people but instead resulted in 5k followers all of whom were white men above the age of 40 from middle america (no shade if that describes you!) This is really good content @ted coming to a Vision Pro near you*



*some day and i bet you’ll be able to thank @zachterrell and @greg for it :) Inspired to see 1G2H evolving w the times

How it started👇         How it’s going👇 Is it a privileged position to look down on airdrop / memecoin culture?

I recognize that there are cool things happening with /degen (for example) but can’t help but find most of it “annoying” tomorrow’s about to be a perfect day. 

see you in the vision pro with my larry latte’s cafe for the feature friday release (and doing real work too!!!) inspired to take this photo by @ted often the most beautiful moments are only visible to those who go against the tide

turn away from the crowd watching the sun set over the ocean and you’ll see the moon rising over cotton candy skies

turn around as everyone’s eyes are watching the bride walk down the aisle and you’ll see the groom in pure bliss Is this the facebook friend interaction thing from back in the days?

remember @ted and @keccers.eth talking about it.

See what you have in common and last interacted with someone

https://buidler.app/insights/samuellhuber i can’t believe someone got paid to write this headline and publish this article*


*insert cheeky statement about how journalists wonder why MSM is doing massive layoffs Let's talk about startup fund raising MLM. Guide me forward here: vanity metrics - regardless of the company's quarterly earnings - is what pumps the valuation and attracts new investors to cough up bigger cheques to inflate the company's bank account.

Am I missing something? last year, i started hosting a Topics of Controversy dinner series.

each dinner is anchored around a taboo topic and kicks off with a few thought-provoking questions before we dive into a respectful discussion / debate.

my biggest takeaway? 

people LOVE to learn IRL with and from each other.

we need more of this. THE GREATEST FORM OF SELF-CARE IS THE UNFOLLOW BUTTON okay guys genuine question

what is lens? legit question: who should i go to for coding lessons? 

i am self-taught in many things but i am turning to a coding teacher/coach bc i must be cutthroat about efficiency and time allocation over the next couple of months.

starting with a $1k engagement.

didn't see this offered in any @bountycaster services i swear to god @zachterrell is the most underrated caster on farcaster and /zach is going to go down in channel history Listening to NPR and thinking you’re well informed is like being a fundamentalist Christian and thinking you have a good understanding of the geological history of the Earth.

NPR has that “women have always been the primary victims of war” energy. its been a month since this banger 😳
feel old yet? hate the faristocracy? now is your time to turn it into the farcaster democracy. choose their fate by voting in round 1 below.

send me your /frames from now until feb 14. 
i guarantee i will try it and give you feedback. 
if i like it, i give you 100 warps.

ps. yes @greg and i are gonna build some and maybe @zachterrell if he wakes up from his zyn coma She knows me too well https://warpcast.com/ted/0x6530c683 i consider myself relatively private and therefore very intentional about my closest friendships.

i’ve known some of my best girl friends for 8+ years each. they all share:

- joie de vivre
- brilliance inside and out
- empathy
- sense of adventure
- cool without knowing it

friendships ebb + flow but i feel v lucky hey @ted did you know you got a cameo on the official WC page? 24 hours into the experiment: 

- my main feed is 10x more tailored to what i want to see when passively scrolling; i am more active b/c i like what i see

- seeing more casts from friends

- as i unfollowed, i noticed i missed lots of casts from people who don't cast regularly... PSA to cast or reply more often! teddit is a fantastic channel name @ted Alright let’s turn the heat up a notch. 

I’ve a lot of discussion on romantic relationships in the west (particularly male/female). A few podcasts blew up specifically on this topic.

I’m on the side of marriage is an increasingly a bad deal for men particularly.

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts. congratulations /ted, we did it here first :). what should i experiment with next?

https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth/0x35026a3e observation: when it comes to consumer crypto, there are many VCs who talk to the talk, but do not walk the walk.

there is even a man who wrote an entire book on a future in which we own our content + audience, yet spends his time on X (where you don't own your content + audience) and not on Farcaster (where you do). PSA: i'm running a personal experiment this week and will be following / unfollowing A LOT to see how it affects my feed.

i encourage you not take it personally. 

in fact (ted life tip), i encourage you not to take anything in life personally. when you don't take things personally, you will feel better and be better. you guys know that babies can’t drink water, right? 

like they can only drink milk (or formula) for awhile.

@greg just learned this from tiktok hahaha and i remember @sanjay telling me this realization right before he had his first baby. https://hackmd.io/@EulerLagrange/HyNl7aHda

Recently started a company in zkTLS, and stumbled on this (IMO) incredible business opportunity.

I think influencer marketing is about to explode given trends in browsers.

Looking for a leader to corral the zeeple to prosperity. I had yet another convo with normie friend about the awesomeness of farcaster and found myself dipping my voice when I mention crypto, waving my hands around to say “it’s not a scam! Well you just have to avoid certain areas..”

Feels like I’m explaining an up and coming neighborhood (which is also a bit wrong) Visual Context most people’s morning affirmations at 8am in venice vs. mine  Why are the ladies suddenly obsessed with hockey playoffs? I posted a take and @ommalik and @tayyab quickly made me realize it was kinda a bad take because it simplified something that shouldn’t be simplified.

I deleted because I don’t want to proliferate the dumbed down thinking, but here are their explanations: I think we are too hard on politicians 

Tech people tend to give more grace to business leaders because we know the struggle and have empathy

But we don't know shit about being public servants. So we have no empathy  and demonize their motives. 

Just like many politicians do to "us" when deriding business people i don't think most of the world realizes that the greatest tech product of this year and potentially next year* will be in our hands in exactly two weeks.

*unless OpenAI launches hardware with Jony Ive's Love From piggy backing off of @ted 's post on luxury beliefs here, milei's speech at the wef positions socialism as a luxury belief (imo)

thoughts?

https://www.youtube.com/live/Pfcd0gWNIog?si=eFlSYpS5DdiAVu2F&t=362 /ted is a channel in pursuit of truth, in defense of optimism. a place for intellectual curiosity and discourse — and, as always, fun. no topic is too taboo.

to build this community, i will incentivize and reward those who engage in the spirit of /ted.

proof of warps: @ivy @bias @benersing @mantej.eth @notdevin.eth strong opinion, strongly held: serious things should be talked about seriously.

if you want to be taken seriously, do not talk about serious things in memes or gen Z/alpha lingo or exaggerated parodies just to make it more approachable or palatable.

you can still make serious things fun, but avoid the above approach. fascinated by Rob Henderson's theory on luxury beliefs.

luxury beliefs exist to indicate evidence of the believer's upper social class + education — yet often harm the lower classes. the new status symbols. 

examples:
- legalize drugs
- healthy at every size
- marriage is oppressive

100 warps for replies, Qs, etc. gm day made. week made. maybe month made. 

got to drive in one of these today :) 🤖 candid thoughts (and warning) on BlackRock's Larry Fink's "endorsement" of crypto ETFs and tokenization.

if you respond with genuine feedback, reactions, counterargument, etc. and continue the conversation, then i will gift you warps. this is your sign to buy them* flowers




*her, him, your friends, your parents, yourself, literally everybody likes flowers except maybe cats ted life tip: if you want to use the internet in a way that is most likely to add to your overall wellbeing, approach it as a social *network* and NOT social *media*.

the social network approach cares about replies, DCs, URL-to-IRL meetings, ongoing convos

the social media approach cares about views, likes, followers the channel/no-channel meta discussion reminds me of two basic human principles:

- the desire to be seen

- the desire to belong ted life tip:

if you have a good retail or service experience, always find (or make) 2 minutes to send an email to corporate to give the employee or store a shout out.

it actually matters.

if you want the future of “service” to be more efficient *and* warm, i promise this type of feedback will help us get there. although i don't agree with everything that GG says, i do agree with him here.

if we — as a society — allow special benefits to applicants to specific religious groups or, in theory, any specific "identity" group, we will be taking two steps backward and instead of finding common ground together. ok now that i have a channel, idk why i have a channel but let’s experiment with it. 

i encourage (+ gift warps) you to post:

-any controversial thoughts; i will engage earnestly + w/ curiosity

-any interesting development you’d want to discuss over dinner; i will discuss

-roasts of me; i will find truth in it my top 2023 lesson:

i don’t believe in “if you build it, they will come” as it relates to startups.

i 100% believe in it as it relates to community.

last year i felt i was missing spaces to express parts of myself IRL.

instead of remaining online, i decided to host meetups w/ zero expectations.

lifechanging. hot take: Bill Ackman’s war on plagiarism is a strategic approach to delegitimize the humanities.

to take down STEM, one would attack the irreproducibility of results.

but to take down the humanities, attack plagiarism — the reproducibility of words.

not fun fact: my molecular biology degree is actually a BA😔 one of the greatest ironies of today is how society seems to be de-stigmatizing mental health issues and embracing therapy at record levels.

cognitive behavioral therapy is a powerful anti-victimization method, yet victimization also seem to be at a record high.

how can this be? how can we ensure CBT > victimization? the only in/out list that ever matters and stays constant year over year…

in:
- thinking for yourself

out:
- group think /brandnew will be the first consumer crypto event actually designed for the *consumer* in consumer crypto.

@boysclub consistently curates the highest quality communal experiences, bringing together the creators and creatives shaping the future of internet culture — you all included.

see y'all in austin on march 12. it is january 2, 2024.

but don't forget it is also just another tuesday of another week that you can choose to set goals and do things that make you closer to the best version of yourself.

you don't need a new calendar year to set goals to create the life you want. 

take it day by day, week by week, month by month. new years day >>> near years eve

always believed this, always will if people live until 200 years old, imagine what it means for:

- relationships with our parents and all of our future generations

- $$ and generational wealth transfer, since $10T+ is expected to be passed from baby boomers to millennials

- education / career / creative pursuits

fascinating thought experiment. when i first started working for a big bank, someone started a rumor about me.

for weeks no one would tell me what it was, not men nor women, until i befriended an assistant and even she was afraid to tell. how bad could it be?

once i found out, the relief was unreal. one of the best rumors it could be.

any guesses? how someone boards a plane, gets into their seat, and then deplanes tells you more about a person than any personality test, astrology sign, corporate performance assessment, etc. ever will. whenever someone is worried about an internet incident (aka online cancellation attempt), just remind them that the DOJ confirmed aliens exist and the internet forgot about it after a week. prediction: SKIMS men’s line is the start of an emerging trend of men’s wellness and beauty.

there’s a vibe shift back to masculinity (somewhat veiled as longevity) that will make way for a male aesthetic industry boom.

what do i think will take off first? testosterone replacement and growth hormone therapies. re DEI: CRT, diversity trainings*, quotas aren’t proven effective + sometimes cause more harm than good to the people they are designed to help.

you know which interventions have proven more effective? not those anchored in a person’s potential bias, but those focused on increasing empathy.

unite, don’t divide. I sent @ted a thread exposing Huberman as a grifter and she has yet to respond. Pls respect her privacy during this difficult time Bryan Johnson’s blueprint is a form of modern religion.

is there a story about human destiny? yes

is there a leader? yes

is there a set of beliefs and rules? yes

are there daily/weekly rituals? yes

are there mottos or symbols? yes

and if you follow all of the above, is there the promise of everlasting life? yes i’ve been thinking about value chains. 

i consume tons of info, then curate the best* into videos for which i, in theory, get paid.

i would want some % of my $$ to go to those who produced / shared the original info, eg @keccers.eth.

does a model like this exist? if yes, how can it be improved? if no, can i do it? merry christmas eve from kid me!!! my least favorite things about the internet:

1. the need to preface curiosity w/ “genuine question” bc it is often assumed that questions are only asked w/ an agenda + therefore inauthentic

2. only the original post ever matters; any revisions, followups, etc you make will be disregarded by the masses

what else? missed opportunity to call this channel /teddit everyday /ai part I:

my ex showed me how helpful ChatGPT could be when it first came out. 

i was shocked how well it could replace a therapist with an objective third party POV. i use it across relationships now.

share screenshots then ask it to analyze, provide recommendations and even help with thought journaling. why i think subscription models (warpcast, X) will win over ad-based models:

peacock's bet on new subscribers gives us an ad-free final quarter of an NFL game, meaning 40% fewer ads and 12 min more of game-related content = superior user experience.

the future is one where anyone is a creator, curation is king, content is queen, and distribution is decentralized. in-house personal brands will win.

yet only 1% of users on social “create” today.

if you want to shape the future of consumer anything, there is no better time than now to start creating. gm
