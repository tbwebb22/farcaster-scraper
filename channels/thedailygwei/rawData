Love that gas is currently 9 GWEI 🤭 Feeling blessed for getting one more chance to buy eth below 3K  🙏🏻😇 Thanks @sassal.eth for the brief mention yesterday that omni was using the deposit address to allocate their airdrop, not the withdrawal address. Agree that it's a weird choice for the same reasons. I had checked my withdrawal address earlier and shrugged it off.

https://youtu.be/Kr2QuNoK534 Recording a new episode with @sassal.eth tonight. Hope it's ok to cast this here. Love that “ETH is AI money” is starting to pick up steam as a narrative. 

It’s also factually true with 2 of the top 5 sources of recent ETH burn coming from AI trading bots. when I saw the ping in the discord I kinda hoped this would lead to us getting the episode with Eric today 😅 Ayyyy top castah in /thedailygwei !🍻 This one hits the heart strings 🫀 When I first heard about Circle halting USDC on Tron I figured it was to remove bad optics prior to their upcoming IPO

Hadn’t considered the consolidation approach Sassal pitched today

Interesting to see if they keep consolidating or if it was just to distance themselves from Tron Starknet is such a flop compared to funding and expectations. And I do not talk about the token - though the airdrop seems like a good time to reflect on it. 

Little users, little activity. Unnecessary friction for devs. 

It looks like they got most of the things wrong. Change my mind? For anyone interested in the client diversity simulator Anthony mentioned today on today's ep from @butta

It’s a small 💎 coming from /ethereum early days! I love “The Larry Fink Supply Sink” but I think it could use a rebrand. What about…

The Fink Sink

For your consideration @eric.eth @sassal.eth ETH technology improved 4% in the past 24hrs 🧘‍♂️😌 I've just watched six episodes in a row. The FOMO of missing something in ETH ecosystem just got smaller. 

Thanks for your work Sassal 🫡 Which part of Vitalik's Ethereum roadmap are you most excited about? This MF has been through a lot (an entire 4-year cycle). What is the largest non-ETH part of your portfolio? On the next /thedailygwei Drive Thru episode, @eric.eth and I will talk about when and how to actually take profits.

We're both giga bullish ETH of course, but crypto markets work in cycles that you can use to your advantage if you play the game right.

Thanks to @kaimi for the topic idea! alright everyone, let's get into it. I would like to listen to the "exit strategy" episode / section. This part of the bull cycle might be the good time to set up such and stick to it. Many ways to think about them and design could be discussed. What did you all think of the Drive Thru episode with @eric.eth?

Did it make you even more bullish ETH? 😏 very interesting to listen to the OTB Weekly Roundup episode right after "DG Drive Thru":

@sassal.eth and @eric.eth "Ethereum ETF is almost a fact and will cause huge inflows"

@mattwalshinbos and @nic "Ethereum ETF won't happen, there will be a long lawsuit or it will happen but inflows will be underwhelming"
