DAO TOKYO will happen in Augüî•
Ready to go?
https://daotokyo.deform.cc/2024-waitlist/ Which 'Formal' DAO discussion tool would people recommend most? 

(i.e. for proposal discussion; not 'informal' discussions like telegram/discord)

discourse? charmverse? others?

Our requirements are we don't want it to feel overwhelming. Token gating would be great, but a nice to have for now Make Love Not Axioms DAO

yeah? We are a DAO, which means when the airdrop comes everyone will be able to have a say in the revolutionary protocol ‚õ©Ô∏è Launch DAO TOKYO 2024 Waitlist ‚õ©Ô∏è

üëá Details below:  CoDAO is here!

Governed by the CO token, CoDAO is for everyone that is imagining and building the future of work.

We have "airdripped" .25% of the CO token supply to a group of power users and fans of Coordinape Gift Circles and CoLinks.

Check eligibility and learn more: coordinape.com/codao if you like role-play, you'll love the Zodiac Roles Mod (v2) üòà

with Roles, you can:
- create new DAO characters (roles) to break monotony
- establish boundaries (permissions) to create trust
- allow non-signers to be alpha

spice up your onchain experiences today #zodiacroleplay üö® Today something interesting happened in a DAO I am part of. Votes were closed for a round to assign the winning projects ($), but it was detected that rules of a "social contract" (word of mouth) that was voted on earlier were violated and this caused an internal communication crisis. 
(1/2) Another good DAO newsletter, DAO times is absolutely killing it... https://daotimes.com/sushiswap-team-is-killing-the-dao-and-more-in-the-dao-times-newsletter-41/ ICYMI: Awesome chat about the MIDAO LLC with @balajis.eth and @thethriller

2020 version of me is jealous of me now üôè Interacting with dApps from your DAO is now easier than ever!

dApp Connect enables DAOs to connect to external dApps using @walletconnect! Add actions such as swapping, staking, and lending to proposals to manage your DAO assets with ease.

Today I'm going to make a submission to /groundsdao art race and try bidding again on a /purple. I'm loving contributing to @hatsprotocol protoDAO.  Feels good to be pulled to contribute again. Hey, everybody. I am currently writing a research paper on the topic of DAO. If anyone knows interesting articles. Please write it down. Looking for philosophical reflections on governance in DAO and conflict prevention in a decentralized environment. Then I will post this articles there. Good day, everyone. is anyone doing a small business or investing through wyoming dao that i can shadow? DAOs need to treat their collective attention and the quality/signal of their ‚Äúinternal‚Äù communications as just as much of a scarce shared resources as their financial assets

Optimism, Nouns, ‚Ä¶? Crowdfunding a Gitcoin matching pool via DAO :) The winning formula for DAOs with tokens: Business, Brand, Utility

1) Generate revenue (business)
2) Help token holders feel something they value (brand)
3) Help token holders do something they value (utility) This is all but inevitable. I can't see this year ending without at least a handful of DAOs natively coming into fruition on FC.

The question is: who will be the first? DAOs are dead? No.

DAOs with only discrete propositional governance, inflexible delegation, and no accountability are dead / will die? Yes.

Its time to evolve. everything always comes back to DAOs 

building/making/doing stuff together is what makes humanity go

https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1776053142360101319 had a DAO dream again this morning while half awake. My brain imagines the future of DAOs/Communities while half awake and it feels very intense...then I wake up and it's only loosely there and I was so sure I was on to something.  Happen to you? Hey /daos community, should we propose hosting a DAO-focused side event at Farcon? Who wants to help? Glad to see an important discussion get shaped in the words of @danimim I‚Äôll be attending and sponsoring this for the second straight year. Part of the appeal is certainly getting to be in this historic and sensational part of the world, at a remarkable, historical venue. But it was also a great event with great content and people. See you there?!! üëÄ Late to this, but what from the x3 Nouns<>FC awarded teams gets you really excited as a DAO discord alternate

From a /daos view, I think /nounspace 's fidgets sound üî•... but I'm biased as always back @willywonka.eth

If you answered 'yes' to any of these then you would love PizzaDAO! We have been onchain since early 2021 and have thrown global pizza parties every Bitcoin Pizza Day (May 22nd) since then.

Join /pizzadao and follow @pizzadao people deride DAOs as "group chats with a shared bank account"

but that actually sounds like a killer product if normies could use it 2 years later and AA is still one of my best references for decentralizing social and cultural organizations.

Shoutout to our countless collaborators, led by @luukdao Anyone have DAO/governance frames they're looking to see built? I'm looking to build out ideas based on what the community wants. https://x.com/sim_pop/status/1772612126202302621?s=46&t=0nxPIfVGRqCZQG30RdM2gw Japan DAO Association launched their website today(their content is Japanese only so far).
https://jpdao.org/
Their activities are:
1. Creating DAO guidelines
2. Certification of DAOs and tools
3. Providing model regulations contracts
4. Education and expansion
5. web3 community
6. Lobbying
7. Study/research I just built a Discourse scraper, and scraped every forum post of 100 DAOs within the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Going to create a custom AI model with all this data soon. 

Let me know if you'd like the full database of your DAO's Discourse and I'll share it with you. I feel like there's so much about web3/DAOs/Organization design that I simply have a hard time wrapping my head around.

I feel like a young wizard trying to read tomes filled with strange arcane symbols. None of it makes sense, but I WANT to make sense of it, because I know what marvelous power they hold. This is what our discord channels look like:

We'll see you there! Okay so hear me out... Anarchist cybernetics, or How to DAO
https://anarchiststudies.org/acybernetics/ How the gang shows support to their friends' posts in the groupchats. Was doing DAO research and stumbled upon this. Very interesting. Didn't even know BORGs were even a thing until now.

https://delphilabs.medium.com/assimilating-the-borg-a-new-cryptolegal-framework-for-dao-adjacent-entities-569e54a43f83 Good description of what a Farcaster native DAO could look like One of the struggles I have with coordination tools or web3 products in general is the lack of focus on decentralized ownership.

Starting a @paragraph newsletter is a great example. You have to create an account with an email or a wallet. But you can't use a gnosis safe multisig to create an account.

DAOproblems Our name means "Free Money" in the romanian language.

We based our entire community on this motto and we stand by it.

What do we mean by this?

(Part 1) how to sunset a DAO in 2 steps with Zodiac üåá

https://exit.gnosisguild.org Hey, my favourite DAO people üì¢

@thethriller and I met at ETHDenver to talk about how we could do more with this DAO channel.

We have lots of FC native plans in mind... but we're starting by setting up a weekly DAO focused /aburra each week. 

We'll call this simply .... DAO Fridays üöÄ GM, bullish on DAOs? Come learn about our approach to upkeep, the D.A.O acronym. 

Twitter Space: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OdJrjgMZZwJX Just speaking to a project about whether their subDAO should be restricted by some sort of veto/timelock from the Parent ‚è±Ô∏è 

Fascinating diving into these kind of nuances. The trade-off between speed of execution vs. robustness is never easy and always differs per use case 

So much experimentation üî• üî• Trying to find the best community to share this idea:
- ‚ÄúPlatform for creating self-reliant food forest dao-connected co-ops‚Äù
- People can buy land and convert it into a co-op, rebuilding the local ecology, making returns over 10-20 years or taking donations
- Can crowd-fund the rebuilding of the environment Good evening, guys and girls. I suppose this is an adequate place for us?

We're a small town project based of a community driven discord server and members with passion and great vision for the entire crypto trading space.

Thank you for welcoming us! Sometimes I feel like it's too much trying to build DAO tooling, progressively decentralizing org structures and procedures, bootstrapped economies, autonomous communities, and also make sure the infrastructure we're using is secure and decentralized (and future-proof).

I just came to DAO around for a good time! Pretty nice UX for @vocdoni to drop a cast in your mentions to alert you to a vote which needs your attention.

Bullish on improved DAO tooling and engagement in 2024. from @packy, 3 years ago this Thursday  FC + Vocdoni makes DAO voting sooooo much easier than the old days of Discord + Snapshot Had the grand pleasure of meeting with Ernest and Trewkat I met via Bankless DAO IRL. Fantastic gathering in my home town. Global connections work. after chatting w/ @ccarella.eth yesterday I'm starting to really geek out about the potential of DAOs using farcaster protocol and in-situ transactions like w/ frames.  I really hope the Farcaster protocol canonizes the 'channels' because I think this will be key for meaningful DAO-centric interfaces to emerge. This was not (just) a shill. For real, what would the ideal DAO client look like for Farcaster? What are the short-comings of Farcaster as a communications tool for DAOs? Lets discuss! What would an ideal Farcaster client look like for a DAO? 

That's what Nounx Farcaster is trying to explore. 3 teams be awarded $100K each to go for it.

https://www.youtube.com/live/ttwuAqczqxo?feature=shared DAOs can move slow and OMG Governance but these things help prevent you from getting rugged. 

So maybe DAOs should be more fun but getting rugged is not fun. I wish more projects experimented with different rounds of airdrops, public goods funding and other initiatives, that target different groups/demographics, to distribute governance power

As far as I know, that's only @optimism atm?

Thanks @rathermercurial Thanks @daobase for hosting a great DAO event during /ethdenver! There were more DAO events this year than ever before, and as always, all were attended by great people doing great decentralized things. ‚ÄúDAOs are like the network equivalent of homeowners‚Äô associations, making and enforcing rules for communities‚Äù This is why DAOs should not use associations (eg Swiss), foundations (eg Cayman, BVI), corporations (eg DE), etc. 

Use a DAO LLC (eg Marshall Islands) so that your DAO is actually in charge, not a board of directors!

- multi-sig (simple group decisions)
- governance contracts (complicated group decisions)
- hatsProtocol (org structure AND org related agreements)

Someone who also is on-chain and not just some TradFi/Legal boomer? 

Pls lmk, would love to chat about some ideas :) Random controv thought üå∂Ô∏è --> could onchain voting rise to mainstream conversation by the end of 2024 based on:

1) A U.S. election that could bring 'vote counting' to the fore again
2) Generative AI making those 'discussions' more charged

https://genuinejack.notion.site/Gather-DAO-Concept-977778b02107406592df76353c309a54 At @decent and Fractal, we're building tools and products necessary for onchain orgs to govern and operate.

In a convo with @shutter‚Äôs DAO 0x36 community members, the topic of "proposal length" was brought up. How can we know the exact time a proposal will expire? Question for my DAOs enthusiasts here:
Assuming there is a project + Dao with a 200k treasury, available for a community to tap into but massively underutilized (let‚Äôs assume no use for the sake of this).
Someone wants to acquire the project to lead and drive it forward.
How could you see a acquisition happen? Something I love about @aragon is there's a huge effort to ensure everyone on the team has technical knowledge. On Fridays we do technical demos/lectures so even non-devs are up to speed and confident talking about the latest developments -- even beyond DAOs. SafeDAO is moving full-steam ahead In this newsletter post, I explain what "onchain organizations" are, to generalize beyond DAOs. Onchain hierarchies can be composed using @hatsprotocol, @safe, Moloch frameworks, etc, and overseen by communities.

today, our team launches Zodiac Roles Modifier v2, a powerful onchain permissions module for smart accounts

Roles allows *any account* to act on behalf of a DAO or other onchain entity üëÄ

Read the full announcement post: https://bit.ly/onchainpermissions The exchange theory of web3 governance

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/kykl.12345 üå∂Ô∏è take: I don't care if your code/nodes are "decentralized". If your project doesn't have a distributed community it can count on (with or without a DAO) if something happens to your core team, then you are not decentralized. Does anyone have any useful metrics on the number of new DAOs created in the space? Ideally new DAOs per month for the past 24 months. Is someone already building a designated app for DAOs on Farcaster protocol? 

You could token gate, have a public channel and private groups.

It could be the Discord/ Telegram killer.

Actually already seeing groups/ DAOs moving away from those platforms to fc In Honolulu for a 8 hour layover on the way to the Marshall Islands to discuss the next generation of great Web3 & DAO laws.

The things I do for you guys!! And on Valentine‚Äôs Day of all days smh ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

üòú actually I love it and we‚Äôre all in this together!!! üôåüèº üíïüíïüíï Anyone else following the story with MangoDAO? @anoncounsel casted earlier in /law-policy about increased regulatory scrutiny towards DEXs. Curious to see how it all unfolds.

https://warpcast.com/anoncounsel/0x0087b4d7 Planning to do a launch soon? This thread is a big pot of knowledge and community sentiment. 

Embrace it. The roll hack was a very clear delineator between ‚Äúexploiters‚Äù and existing community members. We honored all ‚Äúconversions‚Äù at a 1:10 value post-airdrop and put in an applications process in what ppl would today call an ‚Äúanti-Sybil measure‚Äù. Seeing a few articles suggesting that AI-based moderation is the best way to govern DAOs. This seems like a step backwards, as most AIs are centralized entities.

Even in a world of decentralized AI, it seems incorrect as it abstracts agency away from DAO members. It's en vogue to say DAOs shouldn't feel like work but when they are securing millions or billions of dollars, it's totally appropriate for the stakeholders to take it serious and do their due diligence. New Just DAO It! with @thethriller and @cupojoseph just dropped!

We discussed all the major DAO stories and articles of the past few weeks, including @spengrah.eth's piece: "Anticapture"

https://justdaoit.transistor.fm/episodes/just-dao-it-dao-news-interview-with-joseph-schiarizzi-from-open-dollar Elon battling the state of Delaware for company decisions being blocked. Lots of DAOs LLCing in Delaware! Important to remember if you incorporate a DAO that your new and largest stakeholder is now that jurisdiction. We are thinking of building a Farcaster frame that shows you a voting UI that can be connected to a Safe smart account through a oSnap type system.

Or doing anything differently?

I created it and love it simply because it's a place to talk about DAOs, and my mission in life is to help bring DAOs to the world, but I see how channels can also be more than just a topically-organized chat, too. What are your favorite definitions of an ‚Äúorganization‚Äù?

See you around! Need to do some hiring. How do I signal boost this to get some good people reaching out? What DAOs can *not* do: solve problems inherent in human organizations, like bureaucracy, politics, etc...

What DAOs *can* do: enable new kinds cross-jurisdictional, internet native organizations of shapes, sizes and scales not feasible before.

The first thing is impossible. The second thing is a big deal nonetheless Arbitrage these undervalued sources of inspiration to build new DAO tech:

1. agent-based modeling

2. collective intelligence (see Engelbart, Nelson, Kay)

3. cybernetics (see Weiner)

4. parliamentary procedure (i.e. Robert‚Äôs Rules of Order) Most issues in the Governance of a DAO could be solved by just using a dual token system to handle governance

Thanks to frames, you can read it "inline" in this post!

https://solosalon.clinamenic.com/2 huge if true

(its true) foundational thinking about DAOs from @spengrah.eth 

https://twitter.com/spengrah/status/1489659983281242115 Hats Protocol was started by a company and is trying to progressively decentralize, starting with a ProtoDAO. You can check out the org structure by looking at its Hats Tree. Super cool to look at for Org nerds. 

https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/1?compact=true Fresh blog post with updates and new directions forward for Aragon: https://mirror.xyz/0xBc47d7db20b5a518744d62Eb2adf1210ECBc57c2/8hM0wr-tSW8CdDGfwmwSbUIRZsp3xo5_UmjAdOQ8HkI?referrerAddress=0xA01f6D0985389a8E106D3158A9441aC21EAC8D8c Optimism has a 2 House system of Governance; A Token House (Delegates select by Token Holders) and a Citizen House (current RPGF badge holders but soon criteria defined by Governance). Here are their respective responsibilities. Parties can easily distribute tokens to members, based on their ownership.

Degen DAO did a distribution of $DEGEN ‚Äì as you can see on the right, every Party member can claim their tokens in 1 click. According to the new Arc Search, this is how to DAO: DAOs on farcaster 

-organize in admin-led channel 
-create token 
-drop token to active channel users 
-implement token-gated chat for member-only coordination 
-use token tips to pay members 
-use frames for proposals & voting 

s/o $DEGEN & @jacek Marshall Islands sounds right to me!

https://x.com/balajis/status/1751442917603131413?s=46 the biggest issue facing DAOs isn‚Äôt onboarding, it‚Äôs offboarding Starting a DAO doesn't have to be like starting a monolithic company...

One simple app for: chatting, voting, managing a wallet, & crowdfunding (if you need it) ATX DAO hacker meetup in Austin tonight @earth2travis 

https://blocklive.io/event/oz Honored and excited to be wearing a Hat Steward Hat for Hats Protocol. DAOs are hard. Know what is else hard? Running businesses, nonprofits, and civic orgs. Many DAOs try to be all three. 

DAO contributors need to remember that they have chosen the hard path on purpose and set expectations accordingly. Vibe, build, vibe, chill. Interesting read for any DAOs<>reputation people like me - 

My quick thoughts...

https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/designing-reward-systems-for-web3-governance/ Pretty inspiring post by Base on how they will participate in the superchain.

https://paragraph.xyz/@girlfrienddao I just got some of my writing on Blockworks (..though I find it odd how bits get changed to fit the mould).

Anyway see here - https://blockworks.co/news/privacy-dao-governance?nocache

TLDR --> There shouldn't be 100% privacy or 100% transparency. DAO governance requires modular privacy on a proposal by proposal basis Open Dollar is launching its DAO in partnership with Tally. We've taken a governance minimization approach meaning the DAO has as little control as possible, limiting human error and increasing security.

This is the endgame for DAOs

Strides towards separating social from financial capital is key. Thanks @dermot 

I love too from a privacy view that if we get contextual & dynamic reputation right, there's still no need for members to be doxxed Had our kick-off for the @RnDAO fellowship today. 

Over the next 3 months I'll be working with some @ftwdao frens and researching a topic dear to my heart, with the kind support of RnDAO CoLab and Arbitrum.

Research focus: how to go about building the best on-chain game for community-led capital allocation. We are organizing 500+ people HowDAO.xyz event in Denver.

Who should we have as speaker? Who are the best DAO though leaders?

Tag your favorite bellow Modular Mafia vs Monolothic Monstrosity Interested how fellow DAO builders think here.

Should tooling think B2B (i.e. desktop) because the first interaction is usually via workstream or guild leaders? 

Or should they think consumer (i.e. mobile) to make the wider DAO UX sticky?

Maybe B2B2C is a good web2 analogy?

https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth/0x0ca7cf8a hot take: daos should not be hosted on discord. Kinda blows my mind that we're not thinking of DAOs as products. 

Despite the complexity‚ÄîDAOs have internal and external audiences, and exist across multiple channels‚Äîthis is the right framework bc it actually prioritizes UX. 

Yes, DAO members are users. People like to drop The Tyranny of Structurelessness like nothing has changed since 1972. Could you imagine being decentralized before the Internet, let alone the smartphone? 

What other papers that are 52 years old do people drop to make their argument like its still relevant today? DAOs are dead. Long live CROs (Capture-Resistant Orgs).

DAOs are dead. Long live SSOs (Self-Structuring Orgs).

<What is dead may never die. DAOs are here to stay.> self-structuring orgs

decentralized governance power + structured operations

made possible by @hatsprotocol DAOs need to find one use case where their form of governance wins

Sports leagues, HOA‚Äôs, Burger stands, something!

Until a competitive advantage in an existing paradigm is shown, they will continue to flounder Its truly incredible how much Nouns did in 2023. This really flexes the power of DAO's ability to do parallel execution. Check out this video.

https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x20035fea4dd659553233fe5ea3ca207e6427b5eb/22 I was asked my 2024 DAO predictions (see Colinks). Thought I'd cross post here

TLDR:
1) Controversies lead to DAO members demanding onchain accountability
2) Growth of minority groups forking their DAOs
3) Public DAOs start getting front-run by externals orgs
4) Hard questions on DAO member privacy emerge

Thoughts? embarrassed to admit I wrote this today and then discovered that vitalik had already covered similar objections to futarchy previously
https://coda.io/@connor/futarchy

oh well, if I only ever posted things vitalik hadn't covered I would never write at all all DAOs all the time Let‚Äôs look at Optimism Fractal, a group that meets weekly to play experimental consensus games. The event is currently hosted by Optimystics and is open to anybody who wants to attend https://optimismfractal.com üßµ 1/ who is the best thinker on value aligned economic communities? When you read ‚ÄúDAOs and AI‚Äù, what comes to mind? Any specific projects? The sort of copy I'm drafting re: onchain org design/gov/ops services: @polynya: "The ideal way to launch a democratic DAO is to follow the cooperative model instead. There are tons of successful cooperatives with different models to take inspiration from - right from boutique worker DAOs with a handful of people to multi-hundred billion dollar mega cooperative financial institutions." DAOs are not about decentralizing decision-making. DAOs can, and often should, centralize decision-making. Not everyone is an expert on everything.

More important than "participation" in everything a DAOs does, or decides, is that members have better exit, loyalty, and voice options compared to other organizations. Does a DanceDAO exist? üòç Very much digging CoLinks. Its a very interesting new substrate for experimenting with self-generating network incentives

Here's an interesting direction it could take: https://colinks.coordinape.com/post/1359317

Join /nouns by the end of 2024 ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® Let‚Äôs take a look at ProtoDAO, one project currently experimenting with reputation-based governance systems.

ProtoDAO is the onchain organization that stewards Hats Protocol. You can read about Hats Protocol here https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/ 1/ fill in the blank: DAOs - voting = ______ all this degen activity is our chance to deploy experimental mechanisms that make coordinating more profitable than competing

hit me with your best ideas What are the current tool kits for forming a DAO? What are some important things to consider when fundraising for a DAO? It‚Äôs 2030 and you‚Äôre working full-time DAOs. 

Do you work for DAOs? 
Do DAOs work for you?
‚Ä¶or is it an entirely different re-framing of work? Does anyone know of any DAO mergers that have happened? hello :) Thank you for creating this channel, @thethriller !!!

Here is my short take on DAOs

https://www.howdao.xyz/articles/breaking-the-myth-why-starting-small-is-a-strategic-move-for-daos Purple is unique in that it‚Äôs a Nounish DAO in support of a protocol but does not govern the protocol. As the protocol grows new people enter the ecosystem who want to support the protocol & this we have a built in flywheel. I‚Äôd like to see more DAOs like this. What's everyone's favorite DAO definition? I'll share my thoughts on any definition üí≠ 

My favorite definition: DAOs are organizations whose a) onchain elements are b) central to the organizing process and c) where every member can directly influence the execution of key organizational decisions. DAOs are the future but so much needs to be done. 

This serves as a really good primer to issues encountered that i've also experienced.
