☕️🍊🥯🥐 What's the coolest thing you did in crypto last week? Listening to the ep with @tim I realized what a wonderland Ethereum must be for L2s

It's like moving to Scandinavia. It isn't the most affordable location, but high living standards and excellent services quickly make up for higher costs...which aren't so high anymore! 
https://youtu.be/_C9joNz83D0?si=HOfYi9eJTgJoEHQA Do you ever think of Ethereum as a Sci-fi novel?

This would be the KZG ceremony The era of the [insert cup of coffee] has begun...

The daily @trustlessstate latte art tradition 🎨. The Bankless podcast is now 4 years old.

It's never been financial advice but I'm happy to say no one who's listened over these past 4 years is poor.

Through all the ups & downs it's been a great honor to serve crypto w/ @trustlessstate and the @bankless team.

We're headed west. While we need to wait for the roll-up stalwarts to start using blobs before making any conclusion, even with a couple already onboard, L1 rent fees have absolutely vanished.

Thank you @growthepie for providing these quality of insights. Massive. The Dencun hard fork has been finalized now. 

Thanks @ethstaker @sassal.eth for the livestream! Always a pleasure. Blobs arrived to the Mainnet! 

Congrats and BIG Thank You to all Ethereum core developers! A special day for /ethereum. A themed coffee to commemorate it.

The daily @trustlessstate latte art tradition. Happy blob day. Still posting daily blobs till 4844 For me a good blob metaphor is like a sidecar for a motorcycle. What's your analogy? Unsuccessfully attempted a 4844. Iykyk.

A good day. Listened to the @bankless podcast for 2 years. Only 2 months ago I took the plunge and become a Bankless citizen. Today I received my first airdrop of dgen V2 tokens! This one relatively small airdrop  already covered the annual fee to be a bankless citizen! Thanks @rsa.eth and @trustlessstate for all you do! Favorite eps of this week (and beyond): 

Shared Sequencing with @justindrake and Ben Fish 
- a perfect description of how revolutionary it can be for interop

The Future of ETH Staking with @ansgar.eth 
- best explanation of Merkle vs Verkle trees I heard + Ansgar's proposal for the new issuance curve is a must-know! “You should take the whole video down”

Some people absolutely hated our AI Tokens and Narrative Investing podcast.

What did you think? Blobs are coming. Getting closer... /ethereum 

The daily @trustlessstate latte art tradition. Just finished a great cast by @bankless with @ansgar.eth talking about ETH staking and monetary policy. Nice. I really like the detail and the well thought out conversation. 📢 New Claimable - Socketscan Arbitrum Rewards
